**Blendid** is a delicious stand-alone blend of tasks and build tools that form a full-featured modern asset pipeline. It can be used as-is as a static site builder, or can be configured and integrated into your own development environment and site or app structure.

## Blendid 5.0
Blendid is getting an overhaul. We at Viget use Blendid for all of our projects but it is starting to grow stale. In an effort to keep it easy to maintain and valuable for us, we have decided to simplify what it does. This means for version 5, we will be removing the `extras/` directory in favor of the making the default init task as up to date as possible. We are also be adding better documentation to [the wiki](https://github.com/vigetlabs/blendid/wiki) in order to make it clear and useful for the community.

## Quick start on a fresh project (empty directory)
```bash
yarn init
yarn add blendid
yarn blendid init
yarn blendid
```

This will create default src and config files in your directory and start compiling and live-updating files! Try editing them and watch your browser auto-update!
