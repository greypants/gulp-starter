gulp-starter
============

Starter Gulp + Browserify project equipped to handle the following:
- Browserify (with browserify-shim)
- Compass
- CoffeeScript (with source mapping!)
- jQuery (from npm)
- Backbone (from npm)
- Handlebars (as a backbone dependency)
- Non common-js vendor code (like a jQuery plugin)
- LiveReload
- Static Server
- Image optimization
- Error Notifications in Notification Center

If you've never used Node or npm before, you'll need to install Node.
If you use homebrew, do:
```
brew install node
```

Otherwise, you can download and install from [here](http://nodejs.org/download/).

### Install Gulp Globally
Gulp must be installed globally in order to use the command line tools.
```
npm install -g gulp
```

### Install all dependencies
```
npm install
```
This runs through all dependencies listed in `package.json` and downloads them
to a `node_modules` folder in your project directory, so you can `require()` them
later.

### Run gulp and be amazed.
```
gulp
```

This will create and run the task defined in `gulpfile.js`. If you're on OS X,
and have Chrome installed, a window will open displaying the demo page. If not,
you can visit http://localhost:8080 to view the test page.
